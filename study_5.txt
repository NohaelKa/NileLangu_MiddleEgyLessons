<bold> Lesson Number 5 "Biliterals"

Now that you have learned sufficient uniliterals, time to learn biliterals!
biliterals are hieroglyphs that have two sounds.

In this lesson you will learn the following Biliterals:
𓁹, 𓉐, 𓅮, 𓅭, 𓄣, 𓌸

And your first sentence:
𓂋𓏺 𓈖 𓆎𓅓𓏏𓊖:[r n kmt]
Language of Egypt

Now the Egyptians used to write their language without vowels, which makes it difficult to read. But in these lessons, the vowels are referred from Egyptian Coptic dictionaries. Even if the time difference between them is around 1800 years (quite long!), some words have remained the same even if it's quite possible the pronunciation may have been different. The decision taken in this course is that it's better to have a closely authentic pronunciation that a purely imagined one.

The word Egypt was written in hieroglyphic as "kmt", and in coptic letters as "kami". The more close original pronunciation would have been close to "kamit". As in Egyptian coptic, the feminizing letter "t" was dropped from all feminine words.
